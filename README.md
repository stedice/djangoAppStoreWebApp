This is my first attempt using Django (not the movie).

This small Python/Django web application is a simple app store, with a list page and a detail page.

## 


## Installation

Copy the project folder to your system then:

1. **Run the script**. `python manage.py runserver`

## Get Started

After you've started the development server. Navigate to `http://localhost:8000/appStore`.


## Tests

Some tests are available in the `tests` folder. To run them use the command
`python manage.py test appStore/tests`
